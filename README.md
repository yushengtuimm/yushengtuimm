### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a Software Engineer, I've worked on many cross-platform projects from full-stack web, mobile android, and desktop applications using different frameworks and programming languages. Along my coding journey, I realized my passion existed in working with the latest stack of technologies to build full-stack applications that are user-friendly, interactive, and responsive.

  - Tailwindcss a css styling framework. 
  - GraphQL a query language for APIs
